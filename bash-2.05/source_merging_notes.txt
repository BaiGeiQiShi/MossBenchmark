1. In the original Makefile, I removed using -O2, because otherwise the merged source contains __builtin_va_arg_pack and __builtin_va_arg_pack_len, which cannot be handled by Clang.

2. Removed "void" in the declaration/definition of yyerror(...).

3. Removed "add_unwind_protect(& restore_signal_mask, oset);", which is fine if "JOB_CONTROL" is not used.

4. Removed "give_terminal_to(shell_pgrp);", which is fine if "JOB_CONTROL" is not used.

5. Removed "void" in the declaration/definition of initialize_shell_signals(...).



*** NOTE ***

I'm not 100% sure 3 and 4 are safe !!!

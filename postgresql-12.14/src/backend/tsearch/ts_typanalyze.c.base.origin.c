/*
 *	compute_tsvector_stats() -- compute statistics for a tsvector column
 *
 *	This functions computes statistics that are useful for determining @@
 *	operations' selectivity, along with the fraction of non-null rows and
 *	average width.
 *
 *	Instead of finding the most common values, as we do for most datatypes,
 *	we're looking for the most common lexemes. This is more useful, because
 *	there most probably won't be any two rows with the same tsvector and
 *thus the notion of a MCV is a bit bogus with this datatype. With a list of the
 *	most common lexemes we can do a better job at figuring out @@
 *selectivity.
 *
 *	For the same reasons we assume that tsvector columns are unique when
 *	determining the number of distinct values.
 *
 *	The algorithm used is Lossy Counting, as proposed in the paper
 *"Approximate frequency counts over data streams" by G. S. Manku and R.
 *Motwani, in Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Very Large
 *Data Bases, Hong Kong, China, August 2002, section 4.2. The paper is available
 *at http://www.vldb.org/conf/2002/S10P03.pdf
 *
 *	The Lossy Counting (aka LC) algorithm goes like this:
 *	Let s be the threshold frequency for an item (the minimum frequency we
 *	are interested in) and epsilon the error margin for the frequency. Let D
 *	be a set of triples (e, f, delta), where e is an element value, f is
 *that element's frequency (actually, its current occurrence count) and delta is
 *	the maximum error in f. We start with D empty and process the elements
 *in batches of size w. (The batch size is also known as "bucket size" and is
 *	equal to 1/epsilon.) Let the current batch number be b_current, starting
 *	with 1. For each element e we either increment its f count, if it's
 *	already in D, or insert a new triple into D with values (e, 1, b_current
 *	- 1). After processing each batch we prune D, by removing from it all
 *	elements with f + delta <= b_current.  After the algorithm finishes we
 *	suppress all elements from D that do not satisfy f >= (s - epsilon) * N,
 *	where N is the total number of elements in the input.  We emit the
 *	remaining elements with estimated frequency f/N.  The LC paper proves
 *	that this algorithm finds all elements with true frequency at least s,
 *	and that no frequency is overestimated or is underestimated by more than
 *	epsilon.  Furthermore, given reasonable assumptions about the input
 *	distribution, the required table size is no more than about 7 times w.
 *
 *	We set s to be the estimated frequency of the K'th word in a natural
 *	language's frequency table, where K is the target number of entries in
 *	the MCELEM array plus an arbitrary constant, meant to reflect the fact
 *	that the most common words in any language would usually be stopwords
 *	so we will not actually see them in the input.  We assume that the
 *	distribution of word frequencies (including the stopwords) follows
 *Zipf's law with an exponent of 1.
 *
 *	Assuming Zipfian distribution, the frequency of the K'th word is equal
 *	to 1/(K * H(W)) where H(n) is 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n and W is the number
 *of words in the language.  Putting W as one million, we get roughly 0.07/K.
 *	Assuming top 10 words are stopwords gives s = 0.07/(K + 10).  We set
 *	epsilon = s/10, which gives bucket width w = (K + 10)/0.007 and
 *	maximum expected hashtable size of about 1000 * (K + 10).
 *
 *	Note: in the above discussion, s, epsilon, and f/N are in terms of a
 *	lexeme's frequency as a fraction of all lexemes seen in the input.
 *	However, what we actually want to store in the finished pg_statistic
 *	entry is each lexeme's frequency as a fraction of all rows that it
 *occurs in.  Assuming that the input tsvectors are correctly constructed, no
 *	lexeme occurs more than once per tsvector, so the final count f is a
 *	correct estimate of the number of input tsvectors it occurs in, and we
 *	need only change the divisor from N to nonnull_cnt to get the number we
 *	want.

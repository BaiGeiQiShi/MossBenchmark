/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * timeline.c
 *		Functions for reading and writing timeline history files.
 *
 * A timeline history file lists the timeline changes of the timeline, in
 * a simple text format. They are archived along with the WAL segments.
 *
 * The files are named like "<tli>.history". For example, if the database
 * starts up and switches to timeline 5, the timeline history file would be
 * called "00000005.history".
 *
 * Each line in the file represents a timeline switch:
 *
 * <parentTLI> <switchpoint> <reason>
 *
 *	parentTLI	ID of the parent timeline
 *	switchpoint XLogRecPtr of the WAL location where the switch happened
 *	reason		human-readable explanation of why the timeline was
 *changed
 *
 * The fields are separated by tabs. Lines beginning with # are comments, and
 * are ignored. Empty lines are also ignored.

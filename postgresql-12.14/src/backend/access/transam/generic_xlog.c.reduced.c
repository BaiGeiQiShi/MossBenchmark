/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Internally, a delta between pages consists of a set of fragments.  Each
 * fragment represents changes made in a given region of a page.  A fragment
 * is made up as follows:
 *
 * - offset of page region (OffsetNumber)
 * - length of page region (OffsetNumber)
 * - data - the data to place into the region ('length' number of bytes)
 *
 * Unchanged regions of a page are not represented in its delta.  As a result,
 * a delta can be more compact than the full page image.  But having an
 * unchanged region between two fragments that is smaller than the fragment
 * header (offset+length) does not pay off in terms of the overall size of
 * the delta.  For this reason, we merge adjacent fragments if the unchanged
 * region between them is <= MATCH_THRESHOLD bytes.
 *
 * We do not bother to merge fragments across the "lower" and "upper" parts
 * of a page; it's very seldom the case that pd_lower and pd_upper are within
 * MATCH_THRESHOLD bytes of each other, and handling that infrequent case
 * would complicate and slow down the delta-computation code unduly.
 * Therefore, the worst-case delta size includes two fragment headers plus
 * a full page's worth of data.

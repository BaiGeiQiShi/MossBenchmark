 *	NOTES
 *	   Postgres btree pages look like ordinary relation pages.  The opaque
 *	   data at high addresses includes pointers to left and right siblings
 *	   and flag data describing page state.  The first page in a btree, page
 *	   zero, is special -- it stores meta-information describing the tree.
 *	   Pages one and higher store the actual tree data.

 *be a "fast root" (a page that is alone in its level due to deletions). Also,
 *if the root page is split while we are "in flight" to it, what we will return
 *is the old root, which is now just the leftmost page on a
 *probably-not-very-wide level.  For most purposes this is as good as or better

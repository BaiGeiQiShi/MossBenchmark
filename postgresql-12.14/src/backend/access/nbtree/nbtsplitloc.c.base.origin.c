/*
 *	_bt_findsplitloc() -- find an appropriate place to split a page.
 *
 * The main goal here is to equalize the free space that will be on each
 * split page, *after accounting for the inserted tuple*.  (If we fail to
 * account for it, we might find ourselves with too little room on the page
 * that it needs to go into!)
 *
 * If the page is the rightmost page on its level, we instead try to arrange
 * to leave the left split page fillfactor% full.  In this way, when we are
 * inserting successively increasing keys (consider sequences, timestamps,
 * etc) we will end up with a tree whose pages are about fillfactor% full,
 * instead of the 50% full result that we'd get without this special case.
 * This is the same as nbtsort.c produces for a newly-created tree.  Note
 * that leaf and nonleaf pages use different fillfactors.  Note also that
 * there are a number of further special cases where fillfactor is not
 * applied in the standard way.
 *
 * We are passed the intended insert position of the new tuple, expressed as
 * the offsetnumber of the tuple it must go in front of (this could be
 * maxoff+1 if the tuple is to go at the end).  The new tuple itself is also
 * passed, since it's needed to give some weight to how effective suffix
 * truncation will be.  The implementation picks the split point that
 * maximizes the effectiveness of suffix truncation from a small list of
 * alternative candidate split points that leave each side of the split with
 * about the same share of free space.  Suffix truncation is secondary to
 * equalizing free space, except in cases with large numbers of duplicates.
 * Note that it is always assumed that caller goes on to perform truncation,
 * even with pg_upgrade'd indexes where that isn't actually the case
 * (!heapkeyspace indexes).  See nbtree/README for more information about
 * suffix truncation.
 *
 * We return the index of the first existing tuple that should go on the
 * righthand page, plus a boolean indicating whether the new tuple goes on
 * the left or right page.  The bool is necessary to disambiguate the case
 * where firstright == newitemoff.

 * pattern of localized monotonically increasing insertions into a composite
 * index, where leading attribute values form local groupings, and we
 * anticipate further insertions of the same/current grouping (new item's
 * grouping) in the near future.  This can be thought of as a variation on
 * applying leaf fillfactor during rightmost leaf page splits, since cases
 * that benefit will converge on packing leaf pages leaffillfactor% full over
 * time.
 *
 * We may leave extra free space remaining on the rightmost page of a "most
 * significant column" grouping of tuples if that grouping never ends up
 * having future insertions that use the free space.  That effect is
 * self-limiting; a future grouping that becomes the "nearest on the right"
 * grouping of the affected grouping usually puts the extra free space to good
 * use.
 *
 * Caller uses optimization when routine returns true, though the exact action
 * taken by caller varies.  Caller uses original leaf page fillfactor in
 * standard way rather than using the new item offset directly when *usemult
 * was also set to true here.  Otherwise, caller applies optimization by
 * locating the legal split point that makes the new tuple the very last tuple
 * on the left side of the split.

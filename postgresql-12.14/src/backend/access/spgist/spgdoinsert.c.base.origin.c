 * This function splits the leaf tuple set according to picksplit's rules,
 * creating one or more new chains that are spread across the current page
 * and an additional leaf page (we assume that two leaf pages will be
 * sufficient).  A new inner tuple is created, and the parent downlink

 * probably needed).  Failure could occur if the picksplit result is fairly
 * unbalanced, or if newLeafTuple is just plain too big to fit on a page.
 * Because we force the picksplit result to be at least two chains, each
 * cycle will get rid of at least one leaf tuple from the chain, so the loop
 * will eventually terminate if lack of balance is the issue.  If the tuple
 * is too big, we assume that repeated picksplit operations will eventually
 * make it small enough by repeated prefix-stripping.  A broken opclass could
 * make this an infinite loop, though, so spgdoinsert() checks that the
 * leaf datums get smaller each time.

 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Double sorting split algorithm. This is used for both boxes and points.
 *
 * The algorithm finds split of boxes by considering splits along each axis.
 * Each entry is first projected as an interval on the X-axis, and different
 * ways to split the intervals into two groups are considered, trying to
 * minimize the overlap of the groups. Then the same is repeated for the
 * Y-axis, and the overall best split is chosen. The quality of a split is
 * determined by overlap along that axis and some other criteria (see
 * g_box_consider_split).
 *
 * After that, all the entries are divided into three groups:
 *
 * 1) Entries which should be placed to the left group
 * 2) Entries which should be placed to the right group
 * 3) "Common entries" which can be placed to any of groups without affecting
 *	  of overlap along selected axis.
 *
 * The common entries are distributed by minimizing penalty.
 *
 * For details see:
 * "A new double sorting-based node splitting algorithm for R-tree", A. Korotkov
 * http://syrcose.ispras.ru/2011/files/SYRCoSE2011_Proceedings.pdf#page=36

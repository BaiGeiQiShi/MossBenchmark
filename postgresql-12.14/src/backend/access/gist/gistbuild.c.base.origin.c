/*
 * Routines for managing the parent map.
 *
 * Whenever a page is split, we need to insert the downlinks into the parent.
 * We need to somehow find the parent page to do that. In normal insertions,
 * we keep a stack of nodes visited when we descend the tree. However, in
 * buffering build, we can start descending the tree from any internal node,
 * when we empty a buffer by cascading tuples to its children. So we don't
 * have a full stack up to the root available at that time.
 *
 * So instead, we maintain a hash table to track the parent of every internal
 * page. We don't need to track the parents of leaf nodes, however. Whenever
 * we insert to a leaf, we've just descended down from its parent, so we know
 * its immediate parent already. This helps a lot to limit the memory used
 * by this hash table.
 *
 * Whenever an internal node is split, the parent map needs to be updated.
 * the parent of the new child page needs to be recorded, and also the
 * entries for all page whose downlinks are moved to a new page at the split
 * needs to be updated.
 *
 * We also update the parent map whenever we descend the tree. That might seem
 * unnecessary, because we maintain the map whenever a downlink is moved or
 * created, but it is needed because we switch to buffering mode after
 * creating a tree with regular index inserts. Any pages created before
 * switching to buffering mode will not be present in the parent map initially,
 * but will be added there the first time we visit them.

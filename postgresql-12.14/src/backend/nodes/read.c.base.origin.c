/*
 * pg_strtok --- retrieve next "token" from a string.
 *
 * Works kinda like strtok, except it never modifies the source string.
 * (Instead of storing nulls into the string, the length of the token
 * is returned to the caller.)
 * Also, the rules about what is a token are hard-wired rather than being
 * configured by passing a set of terminating characters.
 *
 * The string is assumed to have been initialized already by stringToNode.
 *
 * The rules for tokens are:
 *	* Whitespace (space, tab, newline) always separates tokens.
 *	* The characters '(', ')', '{', '}' form individual tokens even
 *	  without any whitespace around them.
 *	* Otherwise, a token is all the characters up to the next whitespace
 *	  or occurrence of one of the four special characters.
 *	* A backslash '\' can be used to quote whitespace or one of the four
 *	  special characters, so that it is treated as a plain token character.
 *	  Backslashes themselves must also be backslashed for consistency.
 *	  Any other character can be, but need not be, backslashed as well.
 *	* If the resulting token is '<>' (with no backslash), it is returned
 *	  as a non-NULL pointer to the token but with length == 0.  Note that
 *	  there is no other way to get a zero-length token.
 *
 * Returns a pointer to the start of the next token, and the length of the
 * token (including any embedded backslashes!) in *length.  If there are
 * no more tokens, NULL and 0 are returned.
 *
 * NOTE: this routine doesn't remove backslashes; the caller must do so
 * if necessary (see "debackslash").
 *
 * NOTE: prior to release 7.0, this routine also had a special case to treat
 * a token starting with '"' as extending to the next '"'.  This code was
 * broken, however, since it would fail to cope with a string containing an
 * embedded '"'.  I have therefore removed this special case, and instead
 * introduced rules for using backslashes to quote characters.  Higher-level
 * code should add backslashes to a string constant to ensure it is treated
 * as a single token.

 *	* General nodes (via parseNodeString() from readfuncs.c);

 *	* Lists of integers or OIDs.
 * The return value is declared void *, not Node *, to avoid having to
 * cast it explicitly in callers that assign to fields of different types.
 *
 * External callers should always pass NULL/0 for the arguments.  Internally
 * a non-NULL token may be passed when the upper recursion level has already
 * scanned the first token of a node's representation.
 *
 * We assume pg_strtok is already initialized with a string to read (hence
 * this should only be invoked from within a stringToNode operation).

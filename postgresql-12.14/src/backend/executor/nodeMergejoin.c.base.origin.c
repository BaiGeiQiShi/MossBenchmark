/*
 * INTERFACE ROUTINES
 *		ExecMergeJoin			mergejoin outer and inner
 *relations. ExecInitMergeJoin		creates and initializes run time states
 *		ExecEndMergeJoin		cleans up the node.
 *
 * NOTES
 *
 *		Merge-join is done by joining the inner and outer tuples
 *satisfying join clauses of the form ((= outerKey innerKey) ...). The join
 *clause list is provided by the query planner and may contain more than one (=
 *outerKey innerKey) clause (for composite sort key).
 *
 *		However, the query executor needs to know whether an outer
 *		tuple is "greater/smaller" than an inner tuple so that it can
 *		"synchronize" the two relations. For example, consider the
 *following relations:
 *
 *				outer: (0 ^1 1 2 5 5 5 6 6 7)	current tuple: 1
 *				inner: (1 ^3 5 5 5 5 6)			current
 *tuple: 3
 *
 *		To continue the merge-join, the executor needs to scan both
 *inner and outer relations till the matching tuples 5. It needs to know that
 *currently inner tuple 3 is "greater" than outer tuple 1 and therefore it
 *should scan the outer relation first to find a matching tuple and so on.
 *
 *		Therefore, rather than directly executing the merge join
 *clauses, we evaluate the left and right key expressions separately and then
 *		compare the columns one at a time (see MJCompare).  The planner
 *		passes us enough information about the sort ordering of the
 *inputs to allow us to determine how to make the comparison.  We may use the
 *		appropriate btree comparison function, since Postgres' only
 *notion of ordering is specified by btree opfamilies.
 *
 *
 *		Consider the above relations and suppose that the executor has
 *		just joined the first outer "5" with the last inner "5". The
 *		next step is of course to join the second outer "5" with all
 *		the inner "5's". This requires repositioning the inner "cursor"
 *		to point at the first inner "5". This is done by "marking" the
 *		first inner 5 so we can restore the "cursor" to it before
 *joining with the second outer 5. The access method interface provides routines
 *to mark and restore to a tuple.
 *
 *
 *		Essential operation of the merge join algorithm is as follows:
 *
 *		Join {
 *			get initial outer and inner tuples
 *INITIALIZE do forever { while (outer != inner) {
 *SKIP_TEST if (outer < inner) advance outer
 *SKIPOUTER_ADVANCE else advance inner
 *SKIPINNER_ADVANCE
 *				}
 *				mark inner position
 *SKIP_TEST do forever { while (outer == inner) { join tuples
 *JOINTUPLES advance inner position				NEXTINNER
 *					}
 *					advance outer position
 *NEXTOUTER if (outer == mark) TESTOUTER restore inner position to mark
 *TESTOUTER else break	// return to top of outer loop
 *				}
 *			}
 *		}
 *
 *		The merge join operation is coded in the fashion
 *		of a state machine.  At each state, we do something and then
 *		proceed to another state.  This state is stored in the node's
 *		execution state information and is preserved across calls to
 *		ExecMergeJoin. -cim 10/31/89

/*
 * MJEvalOuterValues
 *
 * Compute the values of the mergejoined expressions for the current

 * outer tuple to match anything --- this is true if it yields a NULL
 * input, since we assume mergejoin operators are strict.  If the NULL
 * is in the first join column, and that column sorts nulls last, then
 * we can further conclude that no following tuple can match anything
 * either, since they must all have nulls in the first column.  However,
 * that case is only interesting if we're not in FillOuter mode, else
 * we have to visit all the tuples anyway.
 *
 * For the convenience of callers, we also make this routine responsible
 * for testing for end-of-input (null outer tuple), and returning
 * MJEVAL_ENDOFJOIN when that's seen.  This allows the same code to be used
 * for both real end-of-input and the effective end-of-input represented by
 * a first-column NULL.
 *
 * We evaluate the values in OuterEContext, which can be reset each
 * time we move to a new tuple.

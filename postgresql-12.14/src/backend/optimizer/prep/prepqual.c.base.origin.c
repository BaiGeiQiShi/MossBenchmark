 * prepqual.c
 *	  Routines for preprocessing qualification expressions
 *
 *
 * While the parser will produce flattened (N-argument) AND/OR trees from
 * simple sequences of AND'ed or OR'ed clauses, there might be an AND clause
 * directly underneath another AND, or OR underneath OR, if the input was
 * oddly parenthesized.  Also, rule expansion and subquery flattening could
 * produce such parsetrees.  The planner wants to flatten all such cases
 * to ensure consistent optimization behavior.
 *
 * Formerly, this module was responsible for doing the initial flattening,
 * but now we leave it to eval_const_expressions to do that since it has to
 * make a complete pass over the expression tree anyway.  Instead, we just
 * have to ensure that our manipulations preserve AND/OR flatness.
 * pull_ands() and pull_ors() are used to maintain flatness of the AND/OR
 * tree after local transformations that might introduce nested AND/ORs.

/*
 * negate_clause
 *	  Negate a Boolean expression.
 *
 * Input is a clause to be negated (e.g., the argument of a NOT clause).
 * Returns a new clause equivalent to the negation of the given clause.
 *
 * Although this can be invoked on its own, it's mainly intended as a helper
 * for eval_const_expressions(), and that context drives several design
 * decisions.  In particular, if the input is already AND/OR flat, we must
 * preserve that property.  We also don't bother to recurse in situations
 * where we can assume that lower-level executions of eval_const_expressions
 * would already have simplified sub-clauses of the input.
 *
 * The difference between this and a simple make_notclause() is that this
 * tries to get rid of the NOT node by logical simplification.  It's clearly
 * always a win if the NOT node can be eliminated altogether.  However, our
 * use of DeMorgan's laws could result in having more NOT nodes rather than
 * fewer.  We do that unconditionally anyway, because in WHERE clauses it's
 * important to expose as much top-level AND/OR structure as possible.
 * Also, eliminating an intermediate NOT may allow us to flatten two levels
 * of AND or OR together that we couldn't have otherwise.  Finally, one of
 * the motivations for doing this is to ensure that logically equivalent
 * expressions will be seen as physically equal(), so we should always apply
 * the same transformations.

/*
 * canonicalize_qual
 *	  Convert a qualification expression to the most useful form.
 *
 * This is primarily intended to be used on top-level WHERE (or JOIN/ON)
 * clauses.  It can also be used on top-level CHECK constraints, for which
 * pass is_check = true.  DO NOT call it on any expression that is not known
 * to be one or the other, as it might apply inappropriate simplifications.
 *
 * The name of this routine is a holdover from a time when it would try to
 * force the expression into canonical AND-of-ORs or OR-of-ANDs form.
 * Eventually, we recognized that that had more theoretical purity than
 * actual usefulness, and so now the transformation doesn't involve any
 * notion of reaching a canonical form.
 *
 * NOTE: we assume the input has already been through eval_const_expressions
 * and therefore possesses AND/OR flatness.  Formerly this function included
 * its own flattening logic, but that requires a useless extra pass over the
 * tree.

/*--------------------
 * The following code attempts to apply the inverse OR distributive law:

 * That is, locate OR clauses in which every subclause contains an
 * identical term, and pull out the duplicated terms.
 *
 * This may seem like a fairly useless activity, but it turns out to be
 * applicable to many machine-generated queries, and there are also queries
 * in some of the TPC benchmarks that need it.  This was in fact almost the
 * sole useful side-effect of the old prepqual code that tried to force
 * the query into canonical AND-of-ORs form: the canonical equivalent of
 *		((A AND B) OR (A AND C))
 * is
 *		((A OR A) AND (A OR C) AND (B OR A) AND (B OR C))
 * which the code was able to simplify to
 *		(A AND (A OR C) AND (B OR A) AND (B OR C))
 * thus successfully extracting the common condition A --- but at the cost
 * of cluttering the qual with many redundant clauses.

/*
 * find_duplicate_ors

 * While at it, we remove any NULL constants within the top-level AND/OR
 * structure, eg in a WHERE clause, "x OR NULL::boolean" is reduced to "x".
 * In general that would change the result, so eval_const_expressions can't
 * do it; but at top level of WHERE, we don't need to distinguish between
 * FALSE and NULL results, so it's valid to treat NULL::boolean the same
 * as FALSE and then simplify AND/OR accordingly.  Conversely, in a top-level
 * CHECK constraint, we may treat a NULL the same as TRUE.

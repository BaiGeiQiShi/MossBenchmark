 * shorn of features like subselects, inheritance, aggregates, grouping,
 * and so on.  (Those are the things planner.c deals with.)

/*
 * query_planner
 *	  Generate a path (that is, a simplified plan) for a basic query,
 *	  which may involve joins but not any fancier features.
 *
 * Since query_planner does not handle the toplevel processing (grouping,
 * sorting, etc) it cannot select the best path by itself.  Instead, it
 * returns the RelOptInfo for the top level of joining, and the caller
 * (grouping_planner) can choose among the surviving paths for the rel.
 *
 * root describes the query to plan
 * qp_callback is a function to compute query_pathkeys once it's safe to do so
 * qp_extra is optional extra data to pass to qp_callback
 *
 * Note: the PlannerInfo node also includes a query_pathkeys field, which
 * tells query_planner the sort order that is desired in the final output
 * plan.  This value is *not* available at call time, but is computed by
 * qp_callback once we have completed merging the query's equivalence classes.
 * (We cannot construct canonical pathkeys until that's done.)

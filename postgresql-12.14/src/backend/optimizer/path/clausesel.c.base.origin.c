/*
 * clauselist_selectivity_simple -
 *	  Compute the selectivity of an implicitly-ANDed list of boolean
 *	  expression clauses.  The list can be empty, in which case 1.0
 *	  must be returned.  List elements may be either RestrictInfos
 *	  or bare expression clauses --- the former is preferred since
 *	  it allows caching of results.  The estimatedclauses bitmap tracks
 *	  clauses that have already been estimated by other means.
 *
 * See clause_selectivity() for the meaning of the additional parameters.
 *
 * Our basic approach is to take the product of the selectivities of the
 * subclauses.  However, that's only right if the subclauses have independent
 * probabilities, and in reality they are often NOT independent.  So,
 * we want to be smarter where we can.
 *
 * We also recognize "range queries", such as "x > 34 AND x < 42".  Clauses
 * are recognized as possible range query components if they are restriction
 * opclauses whose operators have scalarltsel or a related function as their
 * restriction selectivity estimator.  We pair up clauses of this form that
 * refer to the same variable.  An unpairable clause of this kind is simply
 * multiplied into the selectivity product in the normal way.  But when we
 * find a pair, we know that the selectivities represent the relative
 * positions of the low and high bounds within the column's range, so instead
 * of figuring the selectivity as hisel * losel, we can figure it as hisel +
 * losel - 1.  (To visualize this, see that hisel is the fraction of the range
 * below the high bound, while losel is the fraction above the low bound; so
 * hisel can be interpreted directly as a 0..1 value but we need to convert
 * losel to 1-losel before interpreting it as a value.  Then the available
 * range is 1-losel to hisel.  However, this calculation double-excludes
 * nulls, so really we need hisel + losel + null_frac - 1.)
 *
 * If either selectivity is exactly DEFAULT_INEQ_SEL, we forget this equation
 * and instead use DEFAULT_RANGE_INEQ_SEL.  The same applies if the equation
 * yields an impossible (negative) result.
 *
 * A free side-effect is that we can recognize redundant inequalities such
 * as "x < 4 AND x < 5"; only the tighter constraint will be counted.
 *
 * Of course this is all very dependent on the behavior of the inequality
 * selectivity functions; perhaps some day we can generalize the approach.

/*
 * clause_selectivity -
 *	  Compute the selectivity of a general boolean expression clause.
 *
 * The clause can be either a RestrictInfo or a plain expression.  If it's
 * a RestrictInfo, we try to cache the selectivity for possible re-use,
 * so passing RestrictInfos is preferred.
 *
 * varRelid is either 0 or a rangetable index.
 *
 * When varRelid is not 0, only variables belonging to that relation are
 * considered in computing selectivity; other vars are treated as constants
 * of unknown values.  This is appropriate for estimating the selectivity of
 * a join clause that is being used as a restriction clause in a scan of a
 * nestloop join's inner relation --- varRelid should then be the ID of the
 * inner relation.
 *
 * When varRelid is 0, all variables are treated as variables.  This
 * is appropriate for ordinary join clauses and restriction clauses.
 *
 * jointype is the join type, if the clause is a join clause.  Pass JOIN_INNER
 * if the clause isn't a join clause.
 *
 * sjinfo is NULL for a non-join clause, otherwise it provides additional
 * context information about the join being performed.  There are some
 * special cases:
 *	1. For a special (not INNER) join, sjinfo is always a member of
 *	   root->join_info_list.
 *	2. For an INNER join, sjinfo is just a transient struct, and only the
 *	   relids and jointype fields in it can be trusted.
 * It is possible for jointype to be different from sjinfo->jointype.
 * This indicates we are considering a variant join: either with
 * the LHS and RHS switched, or with one input unique-ified.
 *
 * Note: when passing nonzero varRelid, it's normally appropriate to set
 * jointype == JOIN_INNER, sjinfo == NULL, even if the clause is really a
 * join clause; because we aren't treating it as a join clause.

 * Send a signal to another backend.
 *
 * The signal is delivered if the user is either a superuser or the same
 * role as the backend being signaled. For "dangerous" signals, an explicit
 * check for superuser needs to be done prior to calling this function.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, 1 on general failure, 2 on normal permission error
 * and 3 if the caller needs to be a superuser.
 *
 * In the event of a general failure (return code 1), a warning message will
 * be emitted. For permission errors, doing that is the responsibility of
 * the caller.

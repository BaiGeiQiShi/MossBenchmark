 *	  MaxConnections, max_worker_processes, max_wal_senders, or
 *	  autovacuum_max_workers higher than his kernel will support, he'll
 *	  find out sooner rather than later.
 *
 *	  Another reason for creating semaphores here is that the semaphore
 *	  implementation typically requires us to create semaphores in the
 *	  postmaster, not in backends.
 *
 * Note: this is NOT called by individual backends under a postmaster,

 * Predicate locks for Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI) are SIREAD
 * locks, which are so different from normal locks that a distinct set of
 * structures is required to handle them.  They are needed to detect
 * rw-conflicts when the read happens before the write.  (When the write
 * occurs first, the reading transaction can check for a conflict by
 * examining the MVCC data.)
 *
 * (1)	Besides tuples actually read, they must cover ranges of tuples
 *		which would have been read based on the predicate.  This will
 *		require modelling the predicates through locks against database
 *		objects such as pages, index ranges, or entire tables.
 *
 * (2)	They must be kept in RAM for quick access.  Because of this, it
 *		isn't possible to always maintain tuple-level granularity --
 *when the space allocated to store these approaches exhaustion, a request for a
 *lock may need to scan for situations where a single transaction holds many
 *fine-grained locks which can be coalesced into a single coarser-grained lock.
 *
 * (3)	They never block anything; they are more like flags than locks
 *		in that regard; although they refer to database objects and are
 *		used to identify rw-conflicts with normal write locks.
 *
 * (4)	While they are associated with a transaction, they must survive
 *		a successful COMMIT of that transaction, and remain until all
 *		overlapping transactions complete.  This even means that they
 *		must survive termination of the transaction's process.  If a
 *		top level transaction is rolled back, however, it is immediately
 *		flagged so that it can be ignored, and its SIREAD locks can be
 *		released any time after that.
 *
 * (5)	The only transactions which create SIREAD locks or check for
 *		conflicts with them are serializable transactions.
 *
 * (6)	When a write lock for a top level transaction is found to cover
 *		an existing SIREAD lock for the same transaction, the SIREAD
 *lock can be deleted.
 *
 * (7)	A write from a serializable transaction must ensure that an xact
 *		record exists for the transaction, with the same lifespan (until
 *		all concurrent transaction complete or the transaction is rolled
 *		back) so that rw-dependencies to that transaction can be
 *		detected.
 *
 * We use an optimization for read-only transactions. Under certain
 * circumstances, a read-only transaction's snapshot can be shown to
 * never have conflicts with other transactions.  This is referred to
 * as a "safe" snapshot (and one known not to be is "unsafe").
 * However, it can't be determined whether a snapshot is safe until
 * all concurrent read/write transactions complete.
 *
 * Once a read-only transaction is known to have a safe snapshot, it
 * can release its predicate locks and exempt itself from further
 * predicate lock tracking. READ ONLY DEFERRABLE transactions run only
 * on safe snapshots, waiting as necessary for one to be available.
 *
 *
 * Lightweight locks to manage access to the predicate locking shared
 * memory objects must be taken in this order, and should be released in
 * reverse order:
 *
 *	SerializableFinishedListLock
 *		- Protects the list of transactions which have completed but
 *which may yet matter because they overlap still-active transactions.
 *
 *	SerializablePredicateLockListLock
 *		- Protects the linked list of locks held by a transaction.  Note
 *			that the locks themselves are also covered by the
 *partition locks of their respective lock targets; this lock only affects the
 *linked list connecting the locks related to a transaction.
 *		- All transactions share this single lock (with no
 *partitioning).
 *		- There is never a need for a process other than the one running
 *			an active transaction to walk the list of locks held by
 *that transaction, except parallel query workers sharing the leader's
 *			transaction.  In the parallel case, an extra per-sxact
 *lock is taken; see below.
 *		- It is relatively infrequent that another process needs to
 *			modify the list for a transaction, but it does happen
 *for such things as index page splits for pages with predicate locks and
 *			freeing of predicate locked pages by a vacuum process.
 *When removing a lock in such cases, the lock itself contains the pointers
 *needed to remove it from the list.  When adding a lock in such cases, the lock
 *can be added using the anchor in the transaction structure.  Neither requires
 *walking the list.
 *		- Cleaning up the list for a terminated transaction is sometimes
 *			not done on a retail basis, in which case no lock is
 *required.
 *		- Due to the above, a process accessing its active transaction's
 *			list always uses a shared lock, regardless of whether it
 *is walking or maintaining the list.  This improves concurrency for the common
 *access patterns.
 *		- A process which needs to alter the list of a transaction other
 *			than its own active transaction must acquire an
 *exclusive lock.
 *
 *	SERIALIZABLEXACT's member 'predicateLockListLock'
 *		- Protects the linked list of locks held by a transaction.  Only
 *			needed for parallel mode, where multiple backends share
 *the same SERIALIZABLEXACT object.  Not needed if
 *			SerializablePredicateLockListLock is held exclusively.
 *
 *	PredicateLockHashPartitionLock(hashcode)
 *		- The same lock protects a target, all locks on that target, and
 *			the linked list of locks on the target.
 *		- When more than one is needed, acquire in ascending address
 *order.
 *		- When all are needed (rare), acquire in ascending index order
 *with PredicateLockHashPartitionLockByIndex(index).
 *
 *	SerializableXactHashLock
 *		- Protects both PredXact and SerializableXidHash.

 * While these operations do not operate entirely within the bounds of

 * The relation passed in must be a heap relation. Any predicate lock of any
 * granularity on the heap will cause a rw-conflict in to this transaction.
 * Predicate locks on indexes do not matter because they only exist to guard
 * against conflicting inserts into the index, and this is a mass *delete*.
 * When a table is truncated or dropped, the index will also be truncated
 * or dropped, and we'll deal with locks on the index when that happens.
 *
 * Dropping or truncating a table also needs to drop any existing predicate
 * locks on heap tuples or pages, because they're about to go away. This
 * should be done before altering the predicate locks because the transaction
 * could be rolled back because of a conflict, in which case the lock changes
 * are not needed. (At the moment, we don't actually bother to drop the
 * existing locks on a dropped or truncated table at the moment. That might
 * lead to some false positives, but it doesn't seem worth the trouble.)

 * segments that have been written since the last checkpoint, so that we can
 * fsync them down to disk before completing the next checkpoint.  This hash
 * table remembers the pending operations.  We use a hash table mostly as
 * a convenient way of merging duplicate requests.
 *
 * We use a similar mechanism to remember no-longer-needed files that can
 * be deleted after the next checkpoint, but we use a linked list instead of
 * a hash table, because we don't expect there to be any duplicate requests.
 *
 * These mechanisms are only used for non-temp relations; we never fsync
 * temp rels, nor do we need to postpone their deletion (see comments in
 * mdunlink).
 *
 * (Regular backends do not track pending operations locally, but forward
 * them to the checkpointer.)

 *
 * rangetypes_spgist.c
 *	  implementation of quad tree over ranges mapped to 2d-points for
 *SP-GiST.
 *
 * Quad tree is a data structure similar to a binary tree, but is adapted to
 * 2d data. Each inner node of a quad tree contains a point (centroid) which
 * divides the 2d-space into 4 quadrants. Each quadrant is associated with a
 * child node.
 *
 * Ranges are mapped to 2d-points so that the lower bound is one dimension,
 * and the upper bound is another. By convention, we visualize the lower bound
 * to be the horizontal axis, and upper bound the vertical axis.
 *
 * One quirk with this mapping is the handling of empty ranges. An empty range
 * doesn't have lower and upper bounds, so it cannot be mapped to 2d space in
 * a straightforward way. To cope with that, the root node can have a 5th
 * quadrant, which is reserved for empty ranges. Furthermore, there can be
 * inner nodes in the tree with no centroid. They contain only two child nodes,
 * one for empty ranges and another for non-empty ones. Such a node can appear
 * as the root node, or in the tree under the 5th child of the root node (in
 * which case it will only contain empty nodes).
 *
 * The SP-GiST picksplit function uses medians along both axes as the centroid.
 * This implementation only uses the comparison function of the range element
 * datatype, therefore it works for any range type.

 *
 * Ranges on one of the axes are taken to lie in the quadrant with higher value

 * to belong to quadrant 1 or 4, and a value on the vertical axis is taken to
 * belong to quadrant 1 or 2. A range equal to centroid is taken to lie in
 * quadrant 1.
 *
 * Empty ranges are taken to lie in the special quadrant 5.

 * or equal to centroid. For brevity, we call the arg < centroid "left", and
 * arg >= centroid case "right". This corresponds to how the quadrants are
 * arranged, if you imagine that "left" is equivalent to "down" and "right"
 * is equivalent to "up".
 *
 * For the "left" case, returns -1, and for the "right" case, returns 1.

/*----------
 * adjacent_inner_consistent
 *
 * Like adjacent_cmp_bounds, but also takes into account the previous
 * level's centroid. We might've traversed left (or right) at the previous
 * node, in search for ranges adjacent to the other bound, even though we
 * already ruled out the possibility for any matches in that direction for
 * this bound. By comparing the argument with the previous centroid, and
 * the previous centroid with the current centroid, we can determine which
 * direction we should've moved in at previous level, and which direction we
 * actually moved.
 *
 * If there can be any matches to the left, returns -1. If to the right,
 * returns 1. If there can be no matches below this centroid, because we
 * already ruled them out at the previous level, returns 0.
 *
 * XXX: Comparing just the previous and current level isn't foolproof; we
 * might still search some branches unnecessarily. For example, imagine that
 * we are searching for value 15, and we traverse the following centroids
 * (only considering one bound for the moment):
 *
 * Level 1: 20
 * Level 2: 50
 * Level 3: 25
 *
 * At this point, previous centroid is 50, current centroid is 25, and the
 * target value is to the left. But because we already moved right from
 * centroid 20 to 50 in the first level, there cannot be any values < 20 in
 * the current branch. But we don't know that just by looking at the previous
 * and current centroid, so we traverse left, unnecessarily. The reason we are
 * down this branch is that we're searching for matches with the *other*
 * bound. If we kept track of which bound we are searching for explicitly,
 * instead of deducing that from the previous and current centroid, we could
 * avoid some unnecessary work.

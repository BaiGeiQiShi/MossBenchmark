 *	  SP-GiST implementation of 4-dimensional quad tree over boxes
 *
 * This module provides SP-GiST implementation for boxes using quad tree
 * analogy in 4-dimensional space.  SP-GiST doesn't allow indexing of
 * overlapping objects.  We are making 2D objects never-overlapping in
 * 4D space.  This technique has some benefits compared to traditional
 * R-Tree which is implemented as GiST.  The performance tests reveal
 * that this technique especially beneficial with too much overlapping
 * objects, so called "spaghetti data".
 *
 * Unlike the original quad tree, we are splitting the tree into 16
 * quadrants in 4D space.  It is easier to imagine it as splitting space
 * two times into 4:
 *
 *				|	   |
 *				|	   |
 *				| -----+-----
 *				|	   |
 *				|	   |
 * -------------+-------------
 *				|
 *				|
 *				|
 *				|
 *				|
 *
 * We are using box datatype as the prefix, but we are treating them
 * as points in 4-dimensional space, because 2D boxes are not enough
 * to represent the quadrant boundaries in 4D space.  They however are
 * sufficient to point out the additional boundaries of the next
 * quadrant.
 *
 * We are using traversal values provided by SP-GiST to calculate and
 * to store the bounds of the quadrants, while traversing into the tree.
 * Traversal value has all the boundaries in the 4D space, and is capable
 * of transferring the required boundaries to the following traversal
 * values.  In conclusion, three things are necessary to calculate the
 * next traversal value:
 *
 *	(1) the traversal value of the parent
 *	(2) the quadrant of the current node
 *	(3) the prefix of the current node
 *
 * If we visualize them on our simplified drawing (see the drawing above);
 * transferred boundaries of (1) would be the outer axis, relevant part
 * of (2) would be the up right part of the other axis, and (3) would be
 * the inner axis.
 *
 * For example, consider the case of overlapping.  When recursion
 * descends deeper and deeper down the tree, all quadrants in
 * the current node will be checked for overlapping.  The boundaries
 * will be re-calculated for all quadrants.  Overlap check answers
 * the question: can any box from this quadrant overlap with the given
 * box?  If yes, then this quadrant will be walked.  If no, then this
 * quadrant will be skipped.
 *
 * This method provides restrictions for minimum and maximum values of
 * every dimension of every corner of the box on every level of the tree
 * except the root.  For the root node, we are setting the boundaries
 * that we don't yet have as infinity.

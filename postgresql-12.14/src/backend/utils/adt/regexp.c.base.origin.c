 *
 *		Alistair Crooks added the code for the regex caching
 *		agc - cached the regular expressions used - there's a good
 *chance that we'll get a hit, so this saves a compile step for every attempted
 *match. I haven't actually measured the speed improvement, but it `looks' a lot
 *quicker visually when watching regression test output.
 *
 *		agc - incorporated Keith Bostic's Berkeley regex code into
 *		the tree for all ports. To distinguish this regex code from any
 *that is existent on a platform, I've prepended the string "pg_" to the
 *functions regcomp, regerror, regexec and regfree. Fixed a bug that was
 *originally a typo by me, where `i' was used instead of `oldest' when compiling
 *regular expressions - benign results mostly, although occasionally it bit
 *you...

 * We cache precompiled regular expressions using a "self organizing list"
 * structure, in which recently-used items tend to be near the front.
 * Whenever we use an entry, it's moved up to the front of the list.
 * Over time, an item's average position corresponds to its frequency of use.
 *
 * When we first create an entry, it's inserted at the front of
 * the array, dropping the entry at the end of the array if necessary to
 * make room.  (This might seem to be weighting the new entry too heavily,
 * but if we insert new entries further back, we'll be unable to adjust to
 * a sudden shift in the query mix where we are presented with MAX_CACHED_RES
 * never-before-seen items used circularly.  We ought to be able to handle
 * that case, so we have to insert at the front.)
 *
 * Knuth mentions a variant strategy in which a used item is moved up just
 * one place in the list.  Although he says this uses fewer comparisons on
 * average, it seems not to adapt very well to the situation where you have
 * both some reusable patterns and a steady stream of non-reusable patterns.
 * A reusable pattern that isn't used at least as often as non-reusable
 * patterns are seen will "fail to keep up" and will drop off the end of the
 * cache.  With move-to-front, a reusable pattern is guaranteed to stay in
 * the cache as long as it's used at least once in every MAX_CACHED_RES uses.

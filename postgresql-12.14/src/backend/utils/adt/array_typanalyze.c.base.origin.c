/*
 * compute_array_stats() -- compute statistics for an array column
 *
 * This function computes statistics useful for determining selectivity of
 * the array operators <@, &&, and @>.  It is invoked by ANALYZE via the
 * compute_stats hook after sample rows have been collected.
 *
 * We also invoke the standard compute_stats function, which will compute
 * "scalar" statistics relevant to the btree-style array comparison operators.
 * However, exact duplicates of an entire array may be rare despite many
 * arrays sharing individual elements.  This especially afflicts long arrays,
 * which are also liable to lack all scalar statistics due to the low
 * WIDTH_THRESHOLD used in analyze.c.  So, in addition to the standard stats,
 * we find the most common array elements and compute a histogram of distinct
 * element counts.
 *
 * The algorithm used is Lossy Counting, as proposed in the paper "Approximate
 * frequency counts over data streams" by G. S. Manku and R. Motwani, in
 * Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases,
 * Hong Kong, China, August 2002, section 4.2. The paper is available at
 * http://www.vldb.org/conf/2002/S10P03.pdf
 *
 * The Lossy Counting (aka LC) algorithm goes like this:
 * Let s be the threshold frequency for an item (the minimum frequency we
 * are interested in) and epsilon the error margin for the frequency. Let D
 * be a set of triples (e, f, delta), where e is an element value, f is that
 * element's frequency (actually, its current occurrence count) and delta is
 * the maximum error in f. We start with D empty and process the elements in
 * batches of size w. (The batch size is also known as "bucket size" and is
 * equal to 1/epsilon.) Let the current batch number be b_current, starting
 * with 1. For each element e we either increment its f count, if it's
 * already in D, or insert a new triple into D with values (e, 1, b_current
 * - 1). After processing each batch we prune D, by removing from it all
 * elements with f + delta <= b_current.  After the algorithm finishes we
 * suppress all elements from D that do not satisfy f >= (s - epsilon) * N,
 * where N is the total number of elements in the input.  We emit the
 * remaining elements with estimated frequency f/N.  The LC paper proves
 * that this algorithm finds all elements with true frequency at least s,
 * and that no frequency is overestimated or is underestimated by more than
 * epsilon.  Furthermore, given reasonable assumptions about the input
 * distribution, the required table size is no more than about 7 times w.
 *
 * In the absence of a principled basis for other particular values, we
 * follow ts_typanalyze() and use parameters s = 0.07/K, epsilon = s/10.
 * But we leave out the correction for stopwords, which do not apply to
 * arrays.  These parameters give bucket width w = K/0.007 and maximum
 * expected hashtable size of about 1000 * K.
 *
 * Elements may repeat within an array.  Since duplicates do not change the
 * behavior of <@, && or @>, we want to count each element only once per
 * array.  Therefore, we store in the finished pg_statistic entry each
 * element's frequency as the fraction of all non-null rows that contain it.
 * We divide the raw counts by nonnull_cnt to get those figures.

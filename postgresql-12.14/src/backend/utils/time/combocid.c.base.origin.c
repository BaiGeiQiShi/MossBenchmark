 * combocid.c
 *	  Combo command ID support routines
 *
 * Before version 8.3, HeapTupleHeaderData had separate fields for cmin
 * and cmax.  To reduce the header size, cmin and cmax are now overlayed
 * in the same field in the header.  That usually works because you rarely
 * insert and delete a tuple in the same transaction, and we don't need
 * either field to remain valid after the originating transaction exits.
 * To make it work when the inserting transaction does delete the tuple,
 * we create a "combo" command ID and store that in the tuple header
 * instead of cmin and cmax. The combo command ID can be mapped to the
 * real cmin and cmax using a backend-private array, which is managed by
 * this module.
 *
 * To allow reusing existing combo cids, we also keep a hash table that
 * maps cmin,cmax pairs to combo cids.  This keeps the data structure size
 * reasonable in most cases, since the number of unique pairs used by any
 * one transaction is likely to be small.
 *
 * With a 32-bit combo command id we can represent 2^32 distinct cmin,cmax
 * combinations. In the most perverse case where each command deletes a tuple
 * generated by every previous command, the number of combo command ids
 * required for N commands is N*(N+1)/2.  That means that in the worst case,
 * that's enough for 92682 commands.  In practice, you'll run out of memory
 * and/or disk space way before you reach that limit.
 *
 * The array and hash table are kept in TopTransactionContext, and are
 * destroyed at the end of each transaction.

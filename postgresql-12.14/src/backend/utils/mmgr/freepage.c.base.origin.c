 * freepage.c
 *	  Management of free memory pages.
 *
 * The intention of this code is to provide infrastructure for memory
 * allocators written specifically for PostgreSQL.  At least in the case
 * of dynamic shared memory, we can't simply use malloc() or even
 * relatively thin wrappers like palloc() which sit on top of it, because
 * no allocator built into the operating system will deal with relative
 * pointers.  In the future, we may find other cases in which greater
 * control over our own memory management seems desirable.
 *
 * A FreePageManager keeps track of which 4kB pages of memory are currently
 * unused from the point of view of some higher-level memory allocator.
 * Unlike a user-facing allocator such as palloc(), a FreePageManager can
 * only allocate and free in units of whole pages, and freeing an
 * allocation can only be done given knowledge of its length in pages.
 *
 * Since a free page manager has only a fixed amount of dedicated memory,
 * and since there is no underlying allocator, it uses the free pages
 * it is given to manage to store its bookkeeping data.  It keeps multiple
 * freelists of runs of pages, sorted by the size of the run; the head of
 * each freelist is stored in the FreePageManager itself, and the first
 * page of each run contains a relative pointer to the next run. See
 * FreePageManagerGetInternal for more details on how the freelists are
 * managed.
 *
 * To avoid memory fragmentation, it's important to consolidate adjacent
 * spans of pages whenever possible; otherwise, large allocation requests
 * might not be satisfied even when sufficient contiguous space is
 * available.  Therefore, in addition to the freelists, we maintain an
 * in-memory btree of free page ranges ordered by page number.  If a
 * range being freed precedes or follows a range that is already free,
 * the existing range is extended; if it exactly bridges the gap between
 * free ranges, then the two existing ranges are consolidated with the
 * newly-freed range to form one great big range of free pages.
 *
 * When there is only one range of free pages, the btree is trivial and
 * is stored within the FreePageManager proper; otherwise, pages are
 * allocated from the area under management as needed.  Even in cases
 * where memory fragmentation is very severe, only a tiny fraction of
 * the pages under management are consumed by this btree.

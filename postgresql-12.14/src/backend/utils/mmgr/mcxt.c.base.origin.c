 *	2.	Context-type-specific routine sets up all type-specific fields
 *of the header (those beyond MemoryContextData proper), as well as any other
 *management fields it needs to have a fully valid context. Usually, failure in
 *this step is impossible, but if it's possible the initial space allocation
 *should be freed before ereport'ing. 3.	Context-type-specific routine
 *calls MemoryContextCreate() to fill in the generic header fields and link the
 *context into the context tree.
 *	4.  We return to the context-type-specific routine, which finishes
 *		up type-specific initialization.  This routine can now do things
 *		that might fail (like allocate more memory), so long as it's
 *		sure the node is left in a state that delete will handle.
 *
 * node: the as-yet-uninitialized common part of the context header node.
 * tag: NodeTag code identifying the memory context type.
 * methods: context-type-specific methods (usually statically allocated).
 * parent: parent context, or NULL if this will be a top-level context.
 * name: name of context (must be statically allocated).
 *
 * Context routines generally assume that MemoryContextCreate can't fail,

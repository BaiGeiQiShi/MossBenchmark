 * NOTES
 *	  It is expected that every bit of a hash function's 32-bit result is
 *	  as random as every other; failure to ensure this is likely to lead
 *	  to poor performance of hash tables.  In most cases a hash
 *	  function should use hash_any() or its variant hash_uint32().

/*
 * This hash function was written by Bob Jenkins
 * (bob_jenkins@burtleburtle.net), and superficially adapted
 * for PostgreSQL by Neil Conway. For more information on this
 * hash function, see http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html,
 * or Bob's article in Dr. Dobb's Journal, Sept. 1997.
 *
 * In the current code, we have adopted Bob's 2006 update of his hash
 * function to fetch the data a word at a time when it is suitably aligned.
 * This makes for a useful speedup, at the cost of having to maintain
 * four code paths (aligned vs unaligned, and little-endian vs big-endian).
 * It also uses two separate mixing functions mix() and final(), instead
 * of a slower multi-purpose function.

/* Get a bit mask of the bits set in non-uint32 aligned addresses */
#define UINT32_ALIGN_MASK (sizeof(uint32) - 1)

/* Rotate a uint32 value left by k bits - note multiple evaluation! */

/*----------
 * mix -- mix 3 32-bit values reversibly.
 *
 * This is reversible, so any information in (a,b,c) before mix() is
 * still in (a,b,c) after mix().
 *
 * If four pairs of (a,b,c) inputs are run through mix(), or through
 * mix() in reverse, there are at least 32 bits of the output that
 * are sometimes the same for one pair and different for another pair.
 * This was tested for:
 * * pairs that differed by one bit, by two bits, in any combination
 *	 of top bits of (a,b,c), or in any combination of bottom bits of
 *	 (a,b,c).
 * * "differ" is defined as +, -, ^, or ~^.  For + and -, I transformed
 *	 the output delta to a Gray code (a^(a>>1)) so a string of 1's (as
 *	 is commonly produced by subtraction) look like a single 1-bit
 *	 difference.
 * * the base values were pseudorandom, all zero but one bit set, or
 *	 all zero plus a counter that starts at zero.
 *
 * This does not achieve avalanche.  There are input bits of (a,b,c)
 * that fail to affect some output bits of (a,b,c), especially of a.  The
 * most thoroughly mixed value is c, but it doesn't really even achieve
 * avalanche in c.
 *
 * This allows some parallelism.  Read-after-writes are good at doubling
 * the number of bits affected, so the goal of mixing pulls in the opposite
 * direction from the goal of parallelism.  I did what I could.  Rotates
 * seem to cost as much as shifts on every machine I could lay my hands on,
 * and rotates are much kinder to the top and bottom bits, so I used rotates.

/*----------
 * final -- final mixing of 3 32-bit values (a,b,c) into c
 *
 * Pairs of (a,b,c) values differing in only a few bits will usually
 * produce values of c that look totally different.  This was tested for
 * * pairs that differed by one bit, by two bits, in any combination
 *	 of top bits of (a,b,c), or in any combination of bottom bits of
 *	 (a,b,c).
 * * "differ" is defined as +, -, ^, or ~^.  For + and -, I transformed
 *	 the output delta to a Gray code (a^(a>>1)) so a string of 1's (as
 *	 is commonly produced by subtraction) look like a single 1-bit
 *	 difference.
 * * the base values were pseudorandom, all zero but one bit set, or
 *	 all zero plus a counter that starts at zero.
 *
 * The use of separate functions for mix() and final() allow for a
 * substantial performance increase since final() does not need to
 * do well in reverse, but is does need to affect all output bits.
 * mix(), on the other hand, does not need to affect all output
 * bits (affecting 32 bits is enough).  The original hash function had
 * a single mixing operation that had to satisfy both sets of requirements
 * and was slower as a result.

/*
 * hash_any() -- hash a variable-length key into a 32-bit value
 *		k		: the key (the unaligned variable-length array
 *of bytes) len		: the length of the key, counting by bytes
 *
 * Returns a uint32 value.  Every bit of the key affects every bit of
 * the return value.  Every 1-bit and 2-bit delta achieves avalanche.
 * About 6*len+35 instructions. The best hash table sizes are powers
 * of 2.  There is no need to do mod a prime (mod is sooo slow!).
 * If you need less than 32 bits, use a bitmask.
 *
 * This procedure must never throw elog(ERROR); the ResourceOwner code
 * relies on this not to fail.
 *
 * Note: we could easily change this function to return a 64-bit hash value

 * elog.c
 *	  error logging and reporting
 *
 * Because of the extremely high rate at which log messages can be generated,
 * we need to be mindful of the performance cost of obtaining any information
 * that may be logged.  Also, it's important to keep in mind that this code may
 * get called from within an aborted transaction, in which case operations
 * such as syscache lookups are unsafe.
 *
 * Some notes about recursion and errors during error processing:
 *
 * We need to be robust about recursive-error scenarios --- for example,
 * if we run out of memory, it's important to be able to report that fact.
 * There are a number of considerations that go into this.
 *
 * First, distinguish between re-entrant use and actual recursion.  It
 * is possible for an error or warning message to be emitted while the
 * parameters for an error message are being computed.  In this case
 * errstart has been called for the outer message, and some field values
 * may have already been saved, but we are not actually recursing.  We handle
 * this by providing a (small) stack of ErrorData records.  The inner message
 * can be computed and sent without disturbing the state of the outer message.
 * (If the inner message is actually an error, this isn't very interesting
 * because control won't come back to the outer message generator ... but
 * if the inner message is only debug or log data, this is critical.)
 *
 * Second, actual recursion will occur if an error is reported by one of
 * the elog.c routines or something they call.  By far the most probable
 * scenario of this sort is "out of memory"; and it's also the nastiest
 * to handle because we'd likely also run out of memory while trying to
 * report this error!  Our escape hatch for this case is to reset the
 * ErrorContext to empty before trying to process the inner error.  Since
 * ErrorContext is guaranteed to have at least 8K of space in it (see mcxt.c),
 * we should be able to process an "out of memory" message successfully.
 * Since we lose the prior error state due to the reset, we won't be able
 * to return to processing the original error, but we wouldn't have anyway.
 * (NOTE: the escape hatch is not used for recursive situations where the
 * inner message is of less than ERROR severity; in that case we just
 * try to process it and return normally.  Usually this will work, but if
 * it ends up in infinite recursion, we will PANIC due to error stack
 * overflow.)
